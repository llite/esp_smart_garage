# esp Smart Garage
Making a Smart Garage out of a couple esp8266s
It ties in with home-assistant using MQTT.
This mainly was done to learn ardunio and MQTT.

# There are better soltions than this, i.e. the [ESPhome](https://esphome.io) project

You will need two esp8266, one will be used to control the garage door opener, and the other will monitor the door and car bays.
Currently it is just using one ultrasonic sensor, but can be expanded to multiple.
